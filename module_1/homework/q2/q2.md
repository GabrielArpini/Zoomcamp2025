# Answer question 2

With the `docker-compose.yaml` file created and running with `docker-compose up -d` we can run the followin command to see more information about the network created, which is `q2_default`:

```bash
docker network inspect q2_default
```

We can see that there is a specific part that shows all the containers in the network:
```
 "Containers": {
            "948d3eeaf98e11c3e99030765dd77e5f3f809dafac05c0bbd3bb02c9e7c40bb1": {
                "Name": "postgres",
                "EndpointID": "09c1319f1d5ef2b51d1d90c3d9a9d95b66ce4dfb3771b462701b1ba178c3558d",
                "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:13:00:02",
                "IPv4Address": "172.19.0.2/16",
                "IPv6Address": ""
            },
            "a14f0b949346affad407b31973ff7054b4f09be14bedcabed9efc9ea679f2f9a": {
                "Name": "pgadmin",
                "EndpointID": "247e847a4321e27715c2495f6f17269279bb9d53a6b48aca1e2f51aaeaac0e88",
                "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:13:00:03",
                "IPv4Address": "172.19.0.3/16",
                "IPv6Address": ""
            }
        },
```
In `the docker-compose.yaml` file we can see the following port configuration:
```
ports:
      - '5433:5432'
```
According to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOr4hTsHOzU&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=17]) video, the first port represents the `host_computer` port and the last port is the `container` port.

answer: `postgres:5432`
