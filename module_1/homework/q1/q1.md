# Answer Question 1

Here is the walktrough i've taken to solve that question:

1-create a Dockerfile, as in this repository.

2-run the following command to build my container:
    ```bash
    docker build q1:q1 .
    ```

3 - run the following command to run my container:
    ```bash
    docker run -it q1:q1
    ```

4 - And, lastly run:
    ```bash
    pip --version
    ```
    Which outputs:
    ```bash
    pip 24.3.1 from /usr/local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pip (python 3.12)
    ```
