Question 3. Trip Segmentation Count

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.yellow_taxi_trips
WHERE trip_distance <= 1;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.yellow_taxi_trips
WHERE trip_distance > 1 AND
trip_distance <= 3;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.yellow_taxi_trips
WHERE trip_distance > 3 AND
trip_distance <= 7;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.yellow_taxi_trips
WHERE trip_distance > 7 AND
trip_distance <= 10;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.yellow_taxi_trips
WHERE trip_distance > 10;

ANSWER:

104,838; 199,013; 109,645; 27,688; 35,202

Question 4. Longest trip for each day

SELECT lpep_pickup_datetime, max(trip_distance)
FROM public.yellow_taxi_trips
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;


Question 5. Three biggest pickup zones
SELECT pgtz."Zone" AS pickup_location,SUM(pytt.total_amount) AS total_amount
FROM public.yellow_taxi_trips AS pytt
JOIN public.green_taxi_zones AS pgtz 
ON pgtz."LocationID" = pytt."PULocationID"
WHERE pytt.lpep_pickup_datetime::DATE = '2019-10-18'
GROUP BY pgtz."Zone"
HAVING SUM(pytt.total_amount) > 13000
ORDER BY total_amount DESC;

TOP 3:
"East Harlem North"
"East Harlem South"
"Morningside Heights"



Question 6. Largest tip

SELECT 
    gtz."Zone" AS dropoff_zone,
    MAX(ytt.tip_amount) AS largest_tip
FROM public.yellow_taxi_trips AS ytt
JOIN public.green_taxi_zones AS gtz 
ON gtz."LocationID" = ytt."DOLocationID"
WHERE ytt."PULocationID" IN (
    SELECT "LocationID"
    FROM public.green_taxi_zones
    WHERE "Zone" = 'East Harlem North'
)
AND ytt.lpep_pickup_datetime BETWEEN '2019-10-01' AND '2019-10-31'
GROUP BY gtz."Zone"
ORDER BY largest_tip DESC
LIMIT 5;
